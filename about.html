              <h4>Peter Rennes</h4>
              <p class="intro">Training has been a central partof Peter's lifestyle from an early age, when he used to mess around with weights with school friends...
                <br>
                <br>
                He discovered circuit training in his late teens; first love and starting point of his career, and it wasn't long before he developed a passion for spin.
                <br>
                <br>
                Peter has a profound understanding of body mechanics and despite its intricacies, he has a way of simplifying the "how's behind the what's" and relaying that knowledge in a way that anyone can understand.
                <br>
                <br>
                He is known for his no nonsense approach to training, for his discipline, charisma and love of music; the driving force behind his workouts.
                <br>
                <br>
                But Peter is also well known for his caring nature, humility, and for his ability to motivate and inspire others to achieve their true potential.
                His unique teaching style is robustly threaded with inspirational words that have long lasting effects on people's mindsets.
                <br>
                <br>
                Having now been in the industry for over 25 years, and involved in fitness fitness most of his life, Peter Rennes is a highly respected figure whose individual lifestyle, creativity, inspirational and motivational prowess have been consistent references for new and established instructors alike.

              <h4>Un Undeniable Legacy</h4>
              <p class="intro">
                Over two decades ago, long before spinbecame the global phenomenon it is today, Peter was already making his mark.
                <br>
                <br>
                With an unparalleled flair for choreography and boundless creativity, he introduced a variety of upper body moves never seen before.
                <br>
                <br>
                This talent took him to Spain and China where he featured as Masetr Instructor and presenter.
                <br>
                <br>
                Hundreds of people have attended Peter's classes over the years, of which many have gone on to become successful instructors in their own rights, and in the process spreading his legacy here in the UK and also overseas.
                <br>
                <br>
                Looking at spin classes in and around London today, it is difficult not to associate the moves we see in many studios with Peter's distinct and original style...
                <br>
                <br>
                Arguably a leading reference in the world of spin.
